VITE_PADDLE_VENDOR_ID=38479
VITE_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
VITE_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN=test_ca902c853e28805f134e43cb27e

## Issue Description

**Problem:**
When accessing the checkout URLs above, we consistently get a "Something went wrong" error page with a "Contact support" button, instead of the expected checkout form.

**What We've Tested:**
1. ✅ Created multiple test products - same issue
2. ✅ Verified all product configurations are complete and active
3. ✅ Confirmed domain approval in Paddle dashboard
4. ✅ Tested with different email addresses and countries
5. ✅ Verified price IDs are correct and active
6. ✅ JavaScript integration works (no console errors)

**Expected Behavior:**
The checkout page should display the product details and payment form for testing with sandbox card numbers.

**Actual Behavior:**
Generic "Something went wrong" error page appears.

## Additional Information

**Test Account for Verification:**
If you need to test our implementation, you can:
1. Visit: https://balanze.cash/settings?tab=plans-usage
2. Click "Get Started" on any Premium plan
3. Click "Pay with Paddle" 
4. This will open the sandbox checkout URL

**Files Attached:**
I've attached a TXT file (paddle-support-details.txt) with all technical configuration details as requested.

## Request

Could you please:
1. Verify our sandbox account configuration (Seller ID: 38479)
2. Check if there are any backend issues with our price IDs
