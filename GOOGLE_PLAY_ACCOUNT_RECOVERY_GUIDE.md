# Google Play Account Termination Recovery Guide

## 🚨 Current Situation

**Status**: Account Terminated (Nov 14, 2025)
**Reason**: High Risk Behavior (Policy Coverage Policy)
**Impact**: All apps removed, cannot publish new apps, new accounts will be closed

---

## 📋 Understanding the Termination

### What "High Risk Behavior" Means

Google Play's Policy Coverage policy allows them to terminate accounts based on:
- **Pattern of harmful behavior** across accounts
- **User complaints** and negative feedback
- **Previous violation history** (even on other accounts)
- **Use of popular brands/assets** without permission
- **News reporting** or external concerns
- **Suspicious activity patterns**

### Why This Happens

1. **Related Account Violations**: If you or someone with access had previous terminated accounts
2. **User Complaints**: Multiple negative reviews or reports
3. **Policy Violations**: Previous warnings or violations that weren't addressed
4. **Brand/Asset Issues**: Using copyrighted material, logos, or names without permission
5. **Suspicious Behavior**: Rapid app creation/deletion, fake reviews, etc.

---

## ✅ Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Do NOT Create New Accounts
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Do NOT attempt to register a new developer account
- Google will close it immediately and won't refund the fee
- This will make recovery harder

### Step 2: Gather All Information

**Document Everything:**
1. **Account History**
   - When was the account created?
   - How many apps were published?
   - Any previous warnings or policy violations?
   - Any related accounts (personal, business, etc.)?

2. **App Information**
   - App name: Balanze
   - Package ID: com.balanze.app
   - Current version and features
   - Screenshots and descriptions

3. **User Feedback**
   - Review all user reviews
   - Check for complaints or negative feedback
   - Document any issues users reported

4. **Previous Communications**
   - Any emails from Google Play?
   - Previous policy warnings?
   - Any appeals or responses?

### Step 3: Review Your App for Compliance

**Check These Critical Areas:**

#### A. Intellectual Property
- ✅ **App Name**: "Balanze" - Is this original or could it conflict with existing brands?
- ✅ **Logo/Assets**: Are all images, icons, and graphics original or properly licensed?
- ✅ **Content**: No copyrighted material without permission
- ✅ **Third-party Services**: Proper attribution for libraries/services used

#### B. Permissions & Privacy
- ✅ **Permissions**: Your app only requests INTERNET (minimal - good!)
- ✅ **Privacy Policy**: Must be accessible and comprehensive
- ✅ **Data Collection**: Clearly disclose what data you collect
- ✅ **Third-party Services**: Disclose use of Supabase, Sentry, Vercel Analytics, etc.

#### C. Financial App Requirements
- ✅ **Financial Services Disclosure**: Required for finance apps
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance**: May need licenses depending on features
- ✅ **Payment Processing**: Proper disclosure of payment methods (Paddle, Stripe, PayPal)
- ✅ **Data Security**: Bank-level security claims must be substantiated

#### D. User Experience
- ✅ **Functionality**: App must work as described
- ✅ **No Misleading Claims**: Don't overpromise features
- ✅ **Support**: Provide contact information
- ✅ **Updates**: Regular updates and bug fixes
